# Finished steps:

1. User model forms updated.
	- Account creation, edit and password change forms interact correctly with password attributes.
	- Creation and edit forms validate email attributes.
	- User and Account models ALMOST populate correctly as sign up template is now run twice, once per model.


# Next Steps:
1. Outline of new strategy/questions:
	- NOTE TO SELF VERY NEXT STEP:
		Make Sign Up Account template that loads directly after sign up user template.
		Sign Up Account template uses the model generated in the sign up user template to have a user attribute.
		I think this project will be near finished once this step is completed! [ ]
	- User model exists by default, use it. [X]
	- Account model related to User model will hold additional attributes. []?????
	- Each form will need to incorporate both models?  Is that a thing?  []?????
	- OR should each template simply contain multiple forms?  Would that work? []
		(Currently trying this.)
	- My password validators might be redundant...? []
	- Templates should be good. [X]
	- URLs should be good. [X]
	- IGNORE EXTRA CREDIT OPTIONS. [X]
2. Verify strategy and steps on Slack.
3. Avoid googling solutions to individual obstacles without a cohesive endgame strategy in place.
