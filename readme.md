# Next Steps:
1. Outline of new strategy:
	- User model exists by default, use it.
	- Account model related to User model will hold additional attributes.
	- Each form will need to incorporate both models?  Is that a thing?  (Ask on Slack!)
	- Password validation for User model should work as-is because validation is form specific and not model specific... right? (Ask Slack!)
	- Templates should be good.
	- URLs should be good.
	- Do I need a different python file for validators?
	- IGNORE EXTRA CREDIT OPTIONS.
2. Verify strategy from PEERS on Slack.
3. Avoid googling solutions individual obstacles without a cohesive strategy in place.
